gst-mjpg
========

# Work-in-Progress

A program similar to mjpg-streamer and ustreamer, but using gstreamer as the underlying video
capture and encoding engine.

This is so you can use the MIPI CSI camera on an ODROID M1 (or other RockChip boards) which aren't
currently supported by most other programs.
